            "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. In this process, the agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions, guiding it towards optimal behavior. However, in many real-world scenarios, defining a reward function can be challenging or even impossible. This is where Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) comes into play.\n",
            "\n",
            "RLHF is a subfield of reinforcement learning where an AI learns from feedback given by humans. By incorporating human feedback into the learning process, RLHF enables AI to improve its performance in complex tasks where a clear reward function is difficult to define.

            "### 2.1 Detailed explanation of RLHF\n",
            "RLHF is a human-in-the-loop approach to reinforcement learning, where a human provides feedback on the agent's behavior. This feedback is then used to update the agent's policy, guiding it towards more desirable actions.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2.2 How it differs from traditional RL\n",
            "In traditional RL, the agent learns from a predefined reward function. In contrast, RLHF allows the agent to learn from human feedback, making it more adaptable to complex, real-world scenarios.\n",
